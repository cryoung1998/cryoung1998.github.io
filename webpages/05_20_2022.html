            <h2>Arrival in Hawaii!</h2>

            <p>We have now finally arrived in Hawaii! We caught an early flight out of San Jose where Giles dropped us off on his way 
                to work. The first flight ended in Maui around 1 PM Hawaii time. We walked around the airport for a little while and 
                were suprised that almost every window in the airport was open. There were small birds flying in and out of the terminals 
                and we were especially hot while waiting in line for starbucks. Soon after we caught our second flight on a much smaller 
                plane just over to Honolulu, which lasted about 45 minutes in total.

            <p>Arriving in Honolulu, Greg our landlord picked us up from the airport and we drove down the famous HWY 3 through the 
                Oahu mountain range to the east side of the island where our house would be. Greg drove us through the town briefly to 
                show us where the local stores were and tell us a little bit about the area. We can't say enough great things about Greg, 
                he has been especially kind and friendly to us so far and has been very active in helping us get settled.

            <p> Once we had arrived at the house and put all our stuff away, Greg offered to take us to the local Safeway to get our 
                first set of groceries and other things we may need for the first week. After we finished shopping he drove us down 
                to the beach overlooks so we could get the first look of the beach where we would be staying.
            </p>
            <p>Seeing the beach in person was really exciting, we can't wait to start exploring the town! Greg informed us that the 
                "flat island" seen in the video is a bird sanctuary, however you can paddle out to it and walk around the outside of it. 
                He also recommended a couple coffee spots and a local market where we could get food and drinks as well. The town itself 
                seems relatively quiet and extremelly nice. When the weather is a little nicer I can only imagine how pretty the landscape 
                must be. Unfortunately it seems we may have brought the undesirable southern winds with us that bring heat and humidity. 
                Greg told us that these "Kona" winds are usually short lived and will soon be replaced with the more favorable northern 
                winds.
