            <p>I'm finding that I really love our small little porch area. It has a great chair to sit outside and really cool views out 
                into the mountains. Sarah and I have been having all of our meals outside here and really enjoying the weather. We went 
                on another short walk today around the other side of the neighborhood, however we stayed around the house because Greg invited 
                us and his other tenant Annie to go out on the lake with him and his family. We met them in the afternoon and had some chips 
                and dip in their backyard where we introduced oursleves. Greg's wife used to be Lawyer and is now going back to school to become 
                a veterinarian and Greg's daughter is in PA school and is working locally in one of the Hawaiin towns. Greg himself spent a lot 
                of his career working for a big name finance company, and then moved to Hawaii and worked remote for IBM. It was really cool to 
                hear their backstories and their long history here on the island. Also, Greg has two little dogs that we got to pet 
                which was fantastic since both Sarah and I are HUGE dog lovers. We then took off on Greg's "boat", which was really just a porch 
                that Greg had fastened to two pontoons and put a motor on. We were able to sit on the floating porch and troll around the lake 
                behind our house for a couple hours, enjoying the island views and getting to know Greg and his family. This was a really cool way 
                to see the island from a new perspective and get some advice on the best things to do locally. Greg's family recommended several 
                beaches, hikes, and activities that we are planning to do in the coming weeks. We have been pleasantly suprised with the hospitality 
                and good nature of Greg and we feel extremelly lucky to have found this place to live!
