            <h2>Getting Settled in Hawaii</h2>

            <p>Our first day in Hawaii remained relatively unneventful. We got a target order delivered at the beginning of the day 
                with all of our stuff we forgot to get from the store and then we set about fully settling into the new studio. It took 
                Sarah and I a little bit of time to get fully unpacked and organized but once we were done we went on a walk around the 
                neighborhood to get a feel for the area and get a little excersize in. The surrounding views were absolutely incredible. 
                We even got a chance to meet our neighbors who were out cleaning their cars. Later that night they came over with two 
                papayas for us and plants that were called 
                <a href="https://www.houseplantsexpert.com/bird-of-paradise-plant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bird of paradise</a>.
                 We were suprised and especially thankful to the neighbors and immediately put the plants in a pot; they really do look impressive! 
                 We also walked all the way down to the pharmacy where Sarah will be working and found that it is a really easy walk. 
                 This is really helpful because we definitely did not plan transportation well and rental cars here are incredible expensive. 
                 For the time being, I think we will have no problem getting around by walking, biking, and the bus. 
                 Now that we are fully settled we are ready to begin exploring Hawaii!
