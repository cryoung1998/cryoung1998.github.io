            <h2>A Day Exploring the West Coast</h2>
            <p>Fair warning, there will be a LOT of images and videos from today. We packed in a full day of redwood trees, ocean views, 
                rock climbing, and scenic drives.
            </p>
            <p>The day began with a short but scenic drive from Giles studio to <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Henry Cowell Redoods State Park</a> where we purchased a park pass and parked to begin hiking. I have been dying to return 
                to the Redwood trees ever since my 10-year old trip with my dad when we visited the Redwood National Park in Northern 
                California. The trees are incredible how tall they reach into the sky and the bark is so tough it almost appears as a kind
                 of polymer or plastic. We didn't take a long hike through the park but we saw many incredible trees, a small stream that 
                 was kind to rock skipping, and tons of birds and other wildlife. I love to hike and explore nature and the Redwood 
                 forests have always fascinated me, I could have spent all day just wandering the trails and marvelling at the trees. 
                 Some of my favorite pictures we took are here below, the scale of the tree against me and Sarah is just incredible.

            <p>Once we left the Redwood Park we took another scenic drive down to Santa Cruz to see some seals and walk the 
                wharf. Santa Cruz was extremelly active, with people walking the beach, sailing in the bay, and fishing off the wharf. 
                By far the coolest part of Santa Cruz was the countless seals swimming in the water and terrorizing the birds. Looking 
                into the water you could see seals flipping through the water as they navigated around each other and to the surface to 
                scare unsuspecting birds floating in the water. At the far end of the wharf there was openings in the walkway where we 
                could look down and see the seals sunbathing and resting on the wooden beams. There was hardly enough room for the seals 
                and we saw several try to jump up, only to knock off some of their friends. Before leaving we stopped in one of the sweets 
                stores on the wharf and purchased some chocolate and maple candy. You can see my reaction to my first bite which I hope to 
                never forget on the right.

            <p>The stop at Santa Cruz was short and we were getting hungry so we made our way to Pebble Beach to have lunch. We drove along 
                17 mile drive to pebble beach which had incredible views over Monterey Bay and made two stops prior to lunch. The first stop 
                was a bathroom break that was really just an excuse to see the luxury of 5-star resort <em>The Inn at Spanish Bay</em> and 
                the second stop was to take some pictures of The Lone Tree seen on the right and take some views of the bay.

            <p>We had lunch at Stillwater Bar & Grill located at Pebble Beach Resorts. I got a delicious personal pizza and we had a 
                nice lunch outside by a gas fire while we could look out onto the bay and watch golfers at the 18th hole. This was a 
                great way to enjoy the views and relax after our busy morning and we enjoyed the break. Giles was bragging about how 
                he had gotten the trip down to a science and that we were just on schedule. I would love to come back sometime during 
                whale watching season and try to spot some whales out in the bay. It was slightly overcast which was a little 
                dissapointing, however it made it a little more comfortable to sit oustide without the glare of the sun. Perhaps some 
                day in the future I will be deceptive enough to trick some golfers into thinking I am capable of these courses, I can 
                only image how cool it must be to have these views while carting around a golf course of that caliber.

            <p>After stopping for lunch we started our drive on Hwy 1 famous for its incredible views of the west coast. The highway 
                definitely lived up to its reputation and I spent the entire drive looking out the windows at the rolling hills 
                and infinitely spanning ocean landscape. We stopped right before the bridge pictures on the right to take some pictures 
                and walk around.
            </p>
            <p>We also stopped briefly at a park to do a quick nature walk along the coast and run on some rocks, however they were 
                closing soon so we went to another public beach access off of Hwy 1 to get closer to the water and do some more climbing. 
                It turned out that this beach was entirely empty and we found a little cove to climb rocks and take some pictures of 
                the beautiful ocean. There is way too many to include just 1 so I put them in a gallery below.

            <p>Our day of exploration ended in Carmel to watch the sunset and walk through the beautiful beach-side town. Halfway 
                through the walk we had all decided this was where we would retire; the houses were beautiful with perfect views of 
                the sunset and Monterey bay. Surfers and swimmers were everywhere on the beach and the town center had numerous small 
                restaurants and storefronts that looked as if they were straight out of a hallmark movie. We found a good spot to watch 
                the sunset and relaxed as our day of adventure came to close.
