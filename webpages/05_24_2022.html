            <p>Today I woke up at 6:30 AM to catch the bus out to the far side of Kaneohe in order to get a bike that I had found on 
                Facebook Marketplace as a way to get around town. The person I was meeting wanted to meet up at the McDonalds close 
                to his house which I found was an hour and a half bus ride from me as I would have to transfer and wait for another bus 
                halfway through. I have to say it was well worth the additional time on the bus to get some of the views of the 
                surrounding mountains and valleys. The scenery here is truly stunning and it was really cool to sit by the window for 
                the first 30 minutes of the bus ride.

            <p>I walked around a little bit during my bus transfer through one of local parks to see some of the local houses. When 
                I finally got to the McDonalds I was astounded by how pretty the location was. Accross the street from the McDonalds is 
                the 
                <a href="https://byodo-in.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valley of the Temples Memorial Park</a> 
                where there is a large Buddhist temple at the top that is incredibly beautiful. I got breakfast at McDonalds and then 
                met the guy with the bike. This bike, as opposed to the one I went to see yesterday, was much nicer and rode well. It 
                is perfect for commuting around town and I purchased it. This is when things started getting a little scary.
            </p>
            <p>When I looked at the bus schedule I realized I would have to wait a full hour for the next bus to come by so I though it 
                would be fine to bike back. Google Maps told me biking would take me 45 minutes and gave me a "safe" route to take home. 
                Right off the bat I realized I made a really bad decision. Thinking I had found a small trail that ran along the highway 
                I began to bike, only to find out shortly that it turned and connected directly onto the highway. The highway itself was 
                under some kind of construction and cones were lined out, limiting the lane sizes considerably. Furthermore, the highway 
                was right by a ditch and had metal barrier on on right side to prevent running vehicles into the forest. For reference, 
                here is photo from google maps.

            <p>There are few time I have been truly afraid in my life, but when I was flying downhil on my new bike with no helmet and 
                cars going by at 40 MPH while my front tire was begging to wobble and there was a large metal barrier on my right I 
                was really afraid. Some guy in a van even yelled out his window as he passed me, "bad idea man, bad idea". He didn't 
                have to tell me that because I had already figured it out, but it definitely helped drive home the danger of the 
                situation. As soon as I got to the bottom of the hill I stopped at the barrier and hopped over the metal railing, where 
                I then walked my bike the remaining half mile alongside the highway until it opend up.
            </p>
            <p>For the next two hours I made a makeshift route back to home riding along roads that were safe and walking along 
                highways that were not. Luckily, it was pretty smooth sailing after the beginning, but I was exhausted. I have not done 
                much strenous excersize for a while and the hills were killing my legs. When I finally got into Kailua town I was 
                overjoyed to find they have biking lanes to get everywhere, which was a huge relief for the final 20 minutes of my trip. 
                When I finally got back to the house just after noon I just needed to decompress. Given how much me and Sarah had travelled 
                over the past two weeks it was nice to have an afternoon in and I facetimed my family to catch up.
            </p>
            <p>One thing for sure, I am never going to bike anywhere along a highway without knowing 100% there are safe bike paths, 
                that was too scary to every try to do again.
