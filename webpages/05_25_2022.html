            <p>Today was Sarah and my first real day at the beach in town. We took the bus in the morning to the closest stop by the beach 
                and walked the remaining 5 minutes to Kailua Beach Park. This has to be one of the prettiest beaches I have ever been to and 
                it was incredibly relaxing to sit by the water and enjoy the scenery. There is a lake in the neighborhood we live in known as 
                "Enchanted Lake" that connects via a small canal to the ocean during high tides, however when we were there it was seperated 
                by a small patch of sand where people were playing volleyball. The water was perfectly refreshing, not cold but definitely not 
                the uncomfortably warm water familiar to South Carolinians in late summer.

            <p>For the first hour or so I read <em>The Subtle Knife</em>, the second book in Phillip Pullmans <em>His Dark Materials</em> 
                trilogy. It was fun to watch the Hawaiin Outrigger canoes paddle along the shore and see so many families playing in the 
                park. It is clear that Kailua remains a largely local beach in comparison to the busy shores on the east side of the 
                island. We did see several visitors like us, but the large majority of beach goers had an "Aloha" auro about them that 
                seems to be inherent to the locals. After relaxing for a while, Sarah and I took a swim and then batted around a wiffle 
                ball with some paddles we found at Target. This was suprisingly fun considering we were aimlessly wacking a ball back 
                and forth.

            <p>Once we got home we finally cut upon the papayas our neighbors had so generously given us. I had no idea how horrible the 
                inside of a papaya smells... it was awful. Once we had properly disposed off the terrible smelling seeds and thoroughly 
                cleaned the kitchen we actually got to enjoy the fruit. I have to say that it was an interesting flavor, still not 
                decided on whether I liked it or not but safe to say it's unlike any other fruit I have ever had.
            </p>
            <p>Overall it was an extremelly successful first beach day and I can't wait to spend more time here in the beautiful waters!
