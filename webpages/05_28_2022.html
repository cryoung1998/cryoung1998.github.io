            <p>Today Sarah and I wanted to try a hike we had seen nearby and read good reviews about called the Lanikai Pillbox Trail. 
                While the main trail enters close to the beach at Lanikai there is a less know entrance that sits at the base of the 
                mountain (more like large hill) about 0.5 miles from where we are staying. The trail then climbs up the top of the 
                closest peak and then walks along the ridgeline to two concrete structures known as "pillboxes". These structures were 
                constructed during WW2 as raised observation points to determine locations of sea vessels that may be approaching the 
                windward side of the island. Now they are covered in grafitti and offer stunning views over the ocean. Using the 
                app AllTrails I created this 
                <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/map-june-16-2022-8-52-pm-3f9e376?u=i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">route</a>
                 to show the nearly 1.25 mile trail we set off to complete. One thing we weren't prepared for was the grade of the trail. 
                 I had assumed incorrectly that because the peak was relatively small the walk up would be easy, but on the contrary it was 
                 roughly a 30 degree grade all the way up to the top. Safe to say we had to make a few stops and water breaks to let our 
                 legs recover, however it was well rewarded with the views from the top. All along the ridgeline you had 360 views of the 
                 entire Hawaiian beach front and mountain ranges and it was truly one of the pretties hikes I have ever been on.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Once we had spent some time enjoying the pillbox views, we continued down the mountain to the beach access side of the trail. 
                It was much more crowded than the side we had come up and was quite difficult to traverse without slipping on gravel and 
                sliding a little ways from time to time. Once we had reached the bottom it was a short walk to the beach which was a 
                huge relief to our tired legs. We relaxed by the water and enjoyed the views of the Mokes, the two islands off the coast 
                that serve as bird sanctuaries now.
            </p>

            <p>While we were sitting on the beach we bought a baked good known as Hawaiian Butter Mochi to snack on. It is similar to 
                Japanese Mochi but without the ice cream. They were absolutely delicious and we devoured the whole tray by the end of 
                the day. I found this 
                <a href="https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/hawaiian-butter-mochi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recipe</a> 
                for butter mochi that looks like it would be well worth a try at some time. Definitely something I hope to have again.
            </p>
            <p>When it started to get a little chilly by the water in the late afternoon we decided to uber back. We had initially been 
                planning to hike the same way back, but our legs were not conditioned to handle that kind of excersize. Our uber driver was 
                a Brazilian named Carlos who moved here to surf and had some great recommendations for places to go to learn to surf. He 
                highly recommended Waikiki as a place to learn this time of year where the waves were relatively small and good for beginners.
