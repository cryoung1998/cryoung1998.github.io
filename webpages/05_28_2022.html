            <p>Today Sarah and I had a nice and relaxing day at the beach at Kailua Beach Park. This was our second time here and it 
                really is a peaceful place to relax by the water. It is incredible how clear the ocean is here. Just like last time 
                there was a large amount of families hanging out in the park as well as locals canoeing in the ocean. There is a 
                small island just off the beach called flat island, although a little research shows that its Hawaiin name is Popoi'a. 
                Interestingly, Popoi'a is apparently Hawaiin for "rotten fish", referring to when Hawaiins used to leave fish on the 
                island as part of a fishing shrine to bring good luck for their fishing ventures. Luckily there was no rotting fish 
                smell today as I can imagine it would greatly detract from the experience. Watching people kayak out to the island Sarah 
                and I began to plan when we would be able to make the trip out there. 
            </p>
            <p>I also managed to finish the second book of <em>His Dark Materials</em> trilogy by Phillip Pullman. Regardless of the 
                heated debate over religion brought on by his books, Phillip is an incredible story teller and character creator. I 
                thoroughly enjoyed the book and look forward to reading the final installment on the next beach trip. Sarah and I enjoyed 
                a long day by the beach relaxing and finished the day with a couple quick ab and cardio excersizes at the house. Sarah even 
                convinced me to do a "dance workout" that she had found on youtube. I have never felt like such a fool trying to follow 
                along with the instructors cardio dance moves...
