            <p>Today ended up being pretty overcast and definitely was not a day we wanted to end up on the beach. Sarah and I decided 
                to stay at home and finish up some computer work and research for upcoming trips. Sarah completed easily the most 
                organized Notion webiste I have ever seen that included daily planners, recipe lists, as well as travel planning for 
                the many trips we hope to take on Oahu. I spent the day finalizing the code for these web journals and testing different 
                styles to make it easier to write each one of these posts. We enjoyed a good bit of time working on the porch outside and 
                enjoying the cool weather.

            <p>After dinner Sarah made these delicious papaya bowl treats, made with fresh fruit, granola, cocunut flakes, and chocolate 
                chips. They were absolutely delicious and definitely raised my opinion of papaya up highly from the day before when I had 
                eaten several slices plain. Still, nothing beats the fresh pinneapple here on the island... that stuff is truly special. We 
                finished the day off with plans to head back to the beach early the next day and enjoy some more time by the water.
