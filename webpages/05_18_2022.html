            <h2>Silicon Valley and PayPal Park</h2>
            <p>Today Giles had to go back to work so I woke up at 6 with him to drive him into work at Tesla's San Jose campus. It was 
                pretty cool to see where he works and get to drive around the highways there, which are much wider and easier to 
                navigate compared to Charleston roads. Sarah and I then went to breakfast at The Breakfast Club at Midtown in San Jose 
                and it was really good. I got a HUGE bagel and we decided to go explore Apple and Googles campuses that were pretty close.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>I was a littel dissapointed to find out that Apples incredible 
                "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spaceship</a>"
                 campus is not accessible unless you 
                have an insider who gets you a visitor pass. I had known about their impressive glass company headquarters and have 
                always wanted to visit so it was a little bit of a let down that the only visitors center was essentially a really fancy 
                Apple Store; plus the augmented reality tour of the building was closed that day so we didn't even get to explore the 
                companies headquarters virtually.

            <p> Google, on the other hand was open and inviting to walk around. It was cool to see all 
                the employees active around the campus, biking between buildings and sitting outside at their cafes. Sarah and I enjoyed 
                walking around their campus for a good bit of time and pretending to recieve important calls regarding Google business; 
                pretty sure we fooled a ton of employees into thinking we were one of them (we didn't). Sarah and I then went into 
                Mountain View to walk around and get some bobba tea from one of the local restaurants and it was delicious!
            </p>
            <p> We drove back into town to pick up Giles as he got off work and bring him back to his studio. Giles went to pick up 
                some Chipotle while Sarah finished her homework and then we went to see a San Jose Earthquakes soccer game at their 
                PayPal park. Gile's and our friend Oskar plays as a center back for their team but unfortunately he was not playing 
                tonight. It ended up being a really entertaining game, ending 3-2 in favor of the Quakes after a come from behind win!
