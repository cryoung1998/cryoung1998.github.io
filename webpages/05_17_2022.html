            <h2>City by the Bay</h2>

            <p>Following our day travelling south along the pacific coast, Giles, Sarah, and I went just north of San Jose to see 
                San Fransisco and the infamous Golden Gate Bridge. To be honest, crossing the bridge itself was not all too impressive, 
                however I had no idea how incredible the bay was to look at from the overlooks above the bridge. On one side you could see 
                infinitely far into the pacific and on the other you could view the different city landscapes that surrounded the bay and 
                the two islands within it. I also had no idea how much trails and wildlife reserve there was on the north side of the bridge, 
                we spent quite some time walking around old army bunkers and through the hills to get different views of the surrounding 
                countryside.

            <p>When we finally decided to continue our exploration we drove down some INSANELY steep roads to a small town called 
                Sausalito. I know the previous day we had decided Carmel by the Sea was our retirement plans, but after visiting 
                Sausalito it became a little less clear. The town was incredible with beautiful parks and gorgeous homes that crawled 
                up the hills, all with incredible overlooks of the bay. We stopped at a delicious coffee shop for lunch and drinks, 
                enjoying the cool weather in the bay. We enjoyed a fun game of <em>"How expensive do you think that house is?"</em>, while 
                we continued our walk into town.
            </p>
            <p>Sarah had to join a meeting online briefly for one of her courses so me and Giles explored some of the local parks 
                while Sarah finished up her meeting. It was nice to relax around town and marvel at the views on the bay. I would love 
                the opportunity to sail around on a nice day and also I would love to visit Alkatraz. Following Sarah's meeting we did 
                some light shopping, where some Asian storeowner tossed a ton of clothes in Sarah's hands and said, "Go, you try on now". 
                After warding off anymore clothes purchases, we got back in Giles car and moved into the actual city.

            <p>When we got to San Francisco we parked at Ghirardelli Square right by the bay. Ghirardelli Chocolate built their 
                factory here in 1817 and it still stands as a famous landmark in the city (See
                <a href="https://www.ghirardellisq.com/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history</a>). From here we 
                caught the cable car that rides along through the city. Giles, Sarah, and I all hung along the outside and enjoyed 
                riding through the city and viewing its sloping city streets and occassional views into the bay and surrounding 
                countryside. 
            </p>
            <p>The cable car ended at Union Square in the city where we found a dinner spot at <em>The Melt</em>. It turned out to 
                be a really good American style restaurant and by the time we had finished eating it was dark outside so we decided to 
                catch the cable car back to Fisherman's Wharf where Ghirardelli Square was located. When we got back we stopped briefly 
                at some cool artwork we found to take a picture and get some of the last views in the city.

            <p>While leaving the city, Giles drove of up to the popular overlook known as Twin Peaks. From here we got an incredible 
                view of the city at night sparking with all of its lights. It was absolutely freezing however, so we did not stay long 
                and drove back to San Jose because Giles had to get back to work in the morning. The day in San Francisco was awesome and
                 it is clear you could spend a long time in the city and still have much to do and see. I can't wait to go back!
