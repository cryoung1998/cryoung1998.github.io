            <p>I dropped Giles off at work again early in the morning and came back to plan breakfast with Sarah. We decided on this 
                floral inspired cafe called 
                <a href="https://kcafesj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K Cafe Patisserie</a>.
                It was incredibly pretty with really good drinks and food. We sat inside in comfy chairs and enjoyed a relaxing morning 
                just talking and admiring the incredible scenery inside the restaurant. We decided to go to Half Moon Beach close by 
                where Sarah had read there was a lot of pretty beach views and relaxing nature walks.

            <p>Driving to Half Moon Bay was really pretty, the highway ran through the hills down towards the ocean making for a fun drive. 
                Half Moon Bay was a really cool town, pretty small honestly, but it had a ton of sailboats anchored at their port and small 
                neighborhoods and restaurants running along the relatively empty highway. We parked at Mavericks Beach and walked down along 
                the crescent beach. We saw some really impressive blue osprey and even got lucky to see a seal bobbing in the ocean. There 
                was several wind surfers out in the ocean and it was cool to watch them fly around the waves. I would love to come back during 
                the Mavericks surfing competition and see the gigantic waves the beach is famous for. 
            </p>

            <p> After we finished walking Mavericks Beach we didn't want to stop exploring, so we decided to go look for some other 
                beaches close by. We ended up finding a small little beach called Moss Beach. It was nestled right under a small cliffside 
                neighborhood and just had two or three parking spots for the nature trails. After walking down to the beach we realized 
                how lucky we were to find this gem on the California coast! The beach was set just under a steep embankment of cypress 
                trees and curved around the coast with numerous rocks to create little tidepools. Unfortunately the tide was just too high 
                to fully explore the tide pools but it was still extremelly fun to walk around the rocks. After we walked around the beach 
                we found a nature trail that walked through the cypress trees above and had incredible views of the surrounding ocean. At 
                the end of the short hike we got rewarded with a beach full of sunbathing seals that we were able to watch from a distance. 
                It was one of the coolest beach hikes I have ever been on.

            <p>It was getting time to pick Giles up from work so we began to head back to San Jose, however Sarah wanted to find a Half Moon 
                Bay sweatshirt to commemorate our trip. We stopped at several stores in town but could not find any good sweatshirts so we 
                called it quits and picked up Giles, only just a little later than we intended too (sorry Giles). This was our last night in 
                California so we were planning to go out to dinner with Giles and Oskar back in town.
            </p>
            <p> For dinner we went to downtown San Jose which had a lot of really cool storefronts and outdoor restaurants. We put our 
                name in at one of the restaurants and continued to walk around town with Giles and Oskar. It was fun to get to sit down 
                and relax with everyone to end the trip. We are especially appreciative of Giles for being a great host and allowing us 
                to take up his small little studio for several days. I definitely can't wait to come back and visit the coastline again, 
                there are still a ton of things I would love to get to do in California!
