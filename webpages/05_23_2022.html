            <h2>Riding the bus</h2>
            <p>Today started out pretty quiet as me and Sarah completed some research on transportation and looked to get two bikes we 
                had found on Facebook marketplace. We found out that the bus system is really well developed here and affordable, only 
                requiring a $2 permanent bus card that can be preloaded with money and maxing out at $5.50/day in riding fares. We came 
                up with a plan to explore the local area bus routes as we went to get our bikes, but first we had a nice lunch on the porch 
                with some fresh pineapple we had bought at the local grocery store. Luckily as we were going to leave into town Greg offerd us 
                a ride, so we got the opportunity to ride in his VW Eos which is a convertible. It was really nice to enjoy the weather driving 
                into town.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Once we got to town we picked up our bus passes and loaded some money on them before ubering back to our house. We wanted to 
                regroup before setting back off, and once we had checked out the bus schedule we set off for the closest stop. When we got on 
                the bus the driver immediately knew we were unfamiliar and allowed us to stand at the front and ask some questions about where 
                we were going. He gave us a great tip to use google maps because it will automatically plan out bus stops and routes. Using his 
                advice we mapped out a route to the bike I was hoping to buy in Kaneohe, the town just north of Kailua.
            </p>
            <p>The bus ride around towards Kaneohe was extremelly pretty and it was cool to see some of the residential areas by the beach. 
                Once we got to my bike we were a little dissapointed to find out that the bike tire was wobbly and the brakes needed to be 
                tightened a ton. Not to mention that the gear shifter didn't work. Needless to say we didn't pick that bike up and took the 
                bus back towards town to get Sarah's bike. That bike was way nicer, even including a bottle opener on the frame that I highly 
                doubt will ever get any use. We picked up the bike and walked back into town to catch one more bus back to our neighborhood. 
                On the way back we saw a chicken make a dart accross the road to avoid being run over by a car. Sarah, seeming to have prepared 
                for this moment her whole life, was overjoyed to ask, "Why did the chicken cross the road?". 
            </p>
            <p>Lucky the bus stops just outside our neighborhood ~7 minutes from our house so it was easy to walk our new bike and beach 
                chair purchase from target back home, marking a successful day around town.
