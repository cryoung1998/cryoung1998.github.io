            <p>Today Sarah and I began our trip to San Jose and then eventually to Hawaii. I decided to write these website based 
                journal entries as a way to both document our travels and practice with some web design. I thought that by using
                 websites as a medium it would allow me to better document information I find along the way as well as pictures and
                  videos I take on the trips.  
            </p>
            <p>We didn't have to catch our flights until 5:30 PM out of Myrtle Beach so I got to spend most of the day with family prior
                to catching the flight out. We were taking Frontier flights and they limit checked bags to 40 lbs. 
                We strategically packed our 3 checked bags using a luggage weight so that when we got to the Frontier counter they
                 weighed 39, 39.5, and 40 lbs. Once boarded on the plane we started watching Formula 1 "Drive to Survive" season 4. 
                 Sarah had already downloaded all of the episodes on her Netflix app and we had been looking forward to finishing this 
                 season.
            </p>

            <p>We had a layover at Denver airport for 3 hours after our first flight. We stopped at The Great Divide restaurant and brewery
                 for drinks and dinner. Following dinner Sarah finished some homework and I read my book, <em>The Subtle Knife</em> by
                  Phillip Pullman, part of the <em>His Dark Materials</em> series. This led us to our second flight, a short jump from
                   Denver to San Francisco.
            </p>
            <p>Landing in San Francisco at 12:30 AM West Coast time, 3:30 AM for us, was pretty exhausting. Giles picked us up from the airport which was really awesome
                 to get to see him after 4 months. It's always a great feeling when you catch up with good friends and no matter how long 
                 it has been since you've seen each other, when you're together it feels like no time passed at all. 
                 We ended up catching up till 5 AM our time, 2 AM in San Jose. Best way to kick
                   off our week trip in California!
