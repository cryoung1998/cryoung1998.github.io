            <h2>Stanford and Palo Alto</h2>
            <div class="supportingImage">
                <img class="imageLeft imageLarge" alt="Giles, Sarah, and Chris in front of Stanford" src="https://chris-young-journal-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/May/15/standfordMainAll.JPG">

            <p>Today marked a much needed rest and relaxing day walking around sunny California. Up to this point Sarah and I have been
                 non-stop. The week prior to the flight to California I was both working and packing up my apartment in preparation for 
                 subleasing while I was gone. I ended up finishing work at Bosch on Friday, the day before we flew here to California; 
                 safe to say I needed a day to sleep in. We all ended up getting up around 11 AM and continued catching up over breakfast
                  in Gile's studio.
            </p>
            <p>When it was finally time to start exploring for the day Giles drove us to Stanford's campus, picking up his friend and
                 previous Clemson Soccer center back Oskar on the way. The four of us spent the next couple hours liesurely walking around 
                 Stanfords beautiful campus and it is without a doubt the coolest college campus I have ever been to. The entire campus is 
                 a big nature walk where all the buildings are architecturally fascinating and everything is integrated seemlessly with 
                 the trees and plants. It made me want to change my whole career path and apply for a graduate degree there just to spend 
                 more time on campus. Not sure I'm the student they'd be looking for though since the whole time we were just joking about 
                 how many Stanford mascots (trees) they put on campus. Their sports complex was especially cool, as everything was 
                 outdoors including their diving pools, volleyball courts, and training facilities.

                <p>Following our long walk around Stanford, we made our way into the nearby town of Palo Alto. Along with Stanford, it was 
                a really nice and relaxing place to walk around, not too unlike downtown Greenville. We stopped to eat at an outdoor 
                restaurant where Sarah took this not too flattering video of the Giles, Oskar, and myself. We then found an ice cream 
                shop called Scoop to get some dessert and it was absolutely delicious.
            </p>
            <p>We ended the day by going to a San Jose Earthquakes 2 game at PayPal park. They were playing Colorado's second team and 
                Giles and Oskar had played with one of the midfielders, Phillip Mayaka, who was starting the game. It was really cool 
                to see how the second level of MLS competed as well as watch a player I had seen a lot of back in Clemson. This was 
                the best way to end a peaceful and entertaining day walking around California.
